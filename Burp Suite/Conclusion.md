Congratulations on completing the Burp Basics room! You now have a solid understanding of the Burp Suite interface, configuration options, and the Burp Proxy. These skills will be essential as you continue your journey in web and mobile application penetration testing.

To further enhance your skills, I encourage you to practice and experiment with Burp Suite. Explore its features, try different configurations, and familiarise yourself with its various tools. The more you use Burp Suite, the more proficient you will become in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.

In the next room of the module, we will dive deeper into Burp Suite Repeater, another powerful tool for manual testing and manipulation of web application requests. Stay curious and keep learning!
